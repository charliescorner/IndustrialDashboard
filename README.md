# IndustrialDashboard
I built this Dashboard for a Industrial/Manufacturing company to use to draw insights from IoT Sensors.

It was a part of a theoretical capstone that I got to take part in at IBM. We all simulated tools that companies from a certain 
market-space (in this case - Industrial) could use to advance their journeys to AI.

We know the power of data - my vision for this is to be able to put data analytics in the form of a dashboard in the hands of 
front line workers - the foreman, laborers, plant workers, etc. that need access to data in order to do their jobs. Let's make
their lives easier - instead of having to pull up data on a computer that may already have changed when they return to their machine,
let's give them access to a dashboard on a tablet that they can have with them at all times.

Data is more powerful if it is accurate and accessible to those who need it. And that is where R Shiny comes in...
